Discussed next steps

How will we populate the feed? List View with recycle view?
How to chronologically order them? Create a timestamp data point in Issue object?
(timestamp not needed because data is accessed in the right order)

4/11 - Virtual Stand-Up
What do we need to do today/tomorrow?
Finish Add Issue page and make sure database has the correct info (Aubin)
Populate database with fake issues (Aubin)
Once this is done, Manage issues page (Mia/Peyton)

Finish UI details (Mia/Peyton)

4/12 - Mia and Peyton Meeting
Solidified UI for Add issue / Edit Issue activities
Checked for views on different screens and landscape view
Edited constraints on activities that needed it
Added warning pop up for Add Issue page, warns that you cannot add issue when Title
 and Summary fields are not filled
Added save button to activity bar in Edit issues page (functionality of button
 for next sprint)

4/14 - Mia and Aubin Meeting
Aubin completed both User/Sga feed with RecyclerView and CardView
Together, working on Issue activity and passing Issue object to them
Discussing logic behind not allowing SGA to vote (OnClick method for Yay,Nay button
 would just bring up statistics, would not alter data)
